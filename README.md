# PPG_signalprocessing_toysexample
A commonly used Butterworth filter was used as low-pass denoising and 11 time-domain features were extracted (including graphing)
Here, I used the PPG dataset provided by another author, https://github.com/she014/PPG-signal-analysis-photoplythesmogram-
I am very grateful to him for providing a short and sufficient csv file in case I can't use the MIMIC database
But to be honest, I didn't refer to his work for the code part, because it's just a short demonstration of time-domain feature extraction, and using matlab's own findpeaks, as well as the diff function, would have been sufficient.
I will follow up by building a real project using wavelet transforms as well as adaptive filters, so stay tuned!
